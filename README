This is a module I attempted to create , which would give you other parameters provided you give one of temperature and pressure and nay other property.

It basically seraches through database files and gives the required output by interpolation and double interpolation.

This is how my module is to be used.

import thermo
a = thermo.State(T = 300 , h = 2354)
print a.getQuality()
0.7183539797807206
print a.getEnthalpy()
2354.0
